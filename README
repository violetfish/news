Dokuwiki Plugin for creating external newsfeeds.

This plugin will generate a news feed that can be read in a standard news reader (See below for how to generate
the feed from the plugin markup.) 

-------------------
Syntax Markup

There are two types of markup.  At the top of a page that holds new items, you must place one of the following:

~~NEWSFEED~~
~~NEWSFEED:<n>~~

First form: ~~NEWSFEED~~
If you use the first form, then you bracket your news items with the following markup:
<news: item_title>
blah blah
</news>

<news: another_item>
blah blah
</news>

The news reader will use your title for the item. You can omit the title:

<news>
blah blah
</news>

In this case the title will default to 'News Item'

Second form: ~~NEWSFEED:<n>~~
In this form, the news items are generated from material which is preceded by Dokuwiki header markup, and the headers
become the titles of the news items.  The <n> designates the number of equal signs that mark up your headers.  The plugin will
create news items from all headers greater than or equal to n.    For instance:
		~~NEWSFEED:3~~
will create items from all headers with with three or more equal signs:
      
      === header 1 ===	  
	  ==== header 2 ====

This page is particularly useful if you have a page which is dedicated to news items.  	  

---------------------
Generating the feed
Each of the following methods generates an xml news feed in your top level dokuwiki directory.   The news feed file is
named news_feed.xml.

The main file for generating news feeds is newsfeed.php, which  is found in news/scripts.

1. place newsfeed.php in your top level dokiuwiki directory and use as your feed url:
            http:/my_web_site.org/my_dokuwiki/newsfeed.php			
   This method adheres to the ttl (time-to-live) configuration setting (see Options below) and creates a new xml file
   only after the ttl has expired.   Until the expiry time, it reads and outputs the previously created news_feed.xml.
  
  However, you can  force a new feed to be created by method 2 or 3.     
  
2. place newsfeed.php in lib/exe and generate the feed from the command line:
            php newsfeed.php
			
3.  open the news admin panel and click on the generate button.		

4. Create a Refresh button:
     ~~NOCACHE~~ 
     ~~NEWS_REFRESH~~
			
If you use method  2 or 3 and do not implement method 1,  then your url must be:
           http:/my_web_site.org/my_dokuwiki/news_feed.xml
		   
		   

---------------
Configuration Options:
1. ttl: Number of minutes before a new feed will be automatically generated
2. title: Feed Title
3. desc: Feed Description.

2 and 3 configure the header section, where the Title is what is feed is known as the the description is a form of subtitle describing the feed further.
---------------------


If you have a version of the news plugin which supports multiple feeds, then you must include a unique feed name in your  ~~NEWSFEED~~ syntax:

		~~NEWSFEED:<n>;;<feed_name>~~.
		~~NEWSFEED:<feed_name>~~

The Refresh button will also require the feed name:
     ~~NEWS_REFRESH:<feed_name>~~ 
The header values for these feeds are configured in the file scripts/newsfeed.ini.
 
You can still use the original syntax, without the feed name; its header title and description will be taken from the default entry in newsfeed.ini or, lacking that, from the options set in the Dokuwiki configuration manager.
